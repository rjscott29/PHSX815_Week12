Contains collegeadmissions.py for creating a plot of data showing a map of the US colleges and if they are affiliated with a religion.

CLT.py simply runs a poisson random variable over n experiments and m games. These are all easily modified and plotted. This was developed inside spyder, and probably will not run properly from the terminal.
